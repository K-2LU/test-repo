## Call Me Kevin

Kevin lives in Cork, Ireland. One day while strolling on the bank of River Lee(a river in Cork, Ireland), he found a bunch of unsorted numbers. Upon seeing those numbers, Kevin started wondering, if the numbers were sorted, where each of those unsorted number would be.

For example, if the numbers were 3, 2, 5, their respective position in the sorted list(2, 3, 5) would be, 2, 1, 3.

Your task is to find the postion of those numbers if they were sorted.

## Input
The first line consists of N, the number of unsorted numbers Kevin found. (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000)

The second line consists of N unsorted numbers, where each of the numbers 1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10000.

## Output

Print the position of each of the members of the unsorted list if they were sorted.
